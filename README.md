Since starting this project I have learnt so much. I have had to go through many hours of just researching a bug I didn't understand and rewrite whole sections as my understanding deepened.

I have tried my best to encorporate all the new things I have learnt and as a first project, there are things I can work on such as creating a role/attribute based admin, more vue functionality and a deeper dive into firestores security rules which are awesome but at the moment, I am happy with this work I have produced.

My passion for self-development and perseverance is embodied in this project.

On to the next one.
